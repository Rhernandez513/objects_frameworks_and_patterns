Our Facility Management system is a self-contained, easy-to-use system for all of your facility management needs!

Some features include:
  Desginate a facilty under maintenance!
  Retreive facility information!
  Automatically retreive and view maintenance requests!
  And that's not all!
    Included with your package is a full test suite, working out the application logic to ensure that the product arrives to you in a pristine state!
    
In recent update, two design patterns are used.
First, Observer Pattern is used. Users can subscribe for update of new maintenance. Once new maintenance is added to maintenance management, subscribed users will receive notification about new maintenance.

Second, Bridge Pattern is used. Different implementations of schedule are used to dynamically bind to facility usage. 


Future Goals:
  We intend to make this project interactive and accept user input to interact with the main business logic.
